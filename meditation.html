        <strong>"Mediation</strong> is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as <a href="assets/html/mindfulness.html"><em>mindfulness</em></a>, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention
        and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.

    <section>
      <p>These days, with the greater need to reduce stress in the midst of our busy schedules and demanding lives, meditation is increasing in popularity.</p>
      <p>Although there isn’t a right or wrong way to meditate, it’s important to find a practice that meets your needs and complements your personality.</p>
      <p>There are nine popular <strong>types of meditation</strong> practice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>mindfulness meditation</li>
        <li>spiritual meditation</li>
        <li>focused meditation</li>
        <li>movement meditation</li>
        <li>mantra meditation</li>
        <li>trascendetal meditation</li>
        <li>progressive relaxation</li>
        <li>loving-kindness meditation</li>
        <li>visualization meditation</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 class="meditation-types">Mindfulness meditation</h3>
      <p>Mindfulness meditation originates from Buddhist teachings and is the most popular meditation technique in the West.</p>
      <p>In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become involved with them. </p>
      <p>This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.</p>
      <p>This type of meditation is good for people who don’t have a teacher to guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.</p>
      <h5 class="iniciate-link"><a href="mindfulness&meditation.html" target="_blank">INICIATE WITH MINDFULNESS MEDITATION!</a></h5>
      <h3 class="meditation-types">Spiritual meditation</h3>
      <p>Spiritual meditation is used in Eastern religions, such as Hinduism and Daoism, and in Christian faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s similar to prayer in that you reflect on the silence around you and seek a deeper connection with your God or Universe.
      </p>
      <p>Spiritual meditation can be practiced at home or in a place of worship. This practice is beneficial for those who thrive in silence and seek spiritual growth.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Essential oils are commonly used to heighten the spiritual experience. Popular options include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>frankincense</li>
        <li>myrrh</li>
        <li>sage</li>
        <li>cedar</li>
        <li>sandalwood</li>
        <li>palo santo</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="meditation-types">Focused meditation</h3>
      <p>Focused meditation involves concentration using any of the five senses.
        <br>
        For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can bring in external influences to help focus your attention.
      </p>
      <p>This practice may be simple in theory, but it can be difficult for beginners to hold their focus for longer than a few minutes at first.
        <br />
        If your mind does wander, it’s important to come back to the practice and refocus.
      </p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This practice is ideal for anyone who requires additional focus in their life.</p>
      <h3 class="meditation-types">Movement meditation</h3>
      <p>
        Although most people think of yoga when they hear movement meditation, this practice may include walking through the woods, gardening, qigong, and other gentle forms of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s an active form of meditation where the movement guides you.
      </p>
      <h5 class="iniciate-link"><a href="https://www.mindful.org/daily-mindful-walking-practice/" target="_blank">LET'S TRY IT!</a></h5>
      <p></p>
      <h3 class="meditation-types">Mantra meditation</h3>
      <p>
        Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This type of meditation uses a repetitive sound to clear the mind. It can be a word, phrase, or sound, such as the popular “Om.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t matter if your mantra is spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, you’ll be more alert and in tune with your environment. This allows you to experience deeper levels of awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people enjoy mantra meditation because they find it easier to focus on a word than on their breath. This is also a good practice for people who don’t like silence and enjoy repetition.
      </p>
      <p>Mantra is a Sanskrit term, with “man” meaning “mind” and “tra” meaning “release.”

        Think of a mantra — a word or phrase you repeat during meditation — as a tool to help release your mind. It can make a lot of difference, especially if you have trouble concentrating or getting in the right frame of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people find that using a mantra can boost awareness and improve concentration. Since it helps you stay focused, it could lead to improved results from meditation.
      </p>
      <h3 class="meditation-types">Trascendental meditation</h3>
      <p>
        Transcendental Meditation is a popular type of meditation. This practice has been the subject of numerous studies in the scientific community.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is more customizable than mantra meditation, using a mantra or series of words that are specific to each practitioner.
      </p>
      <p>
        This practice is for those who like structure and are serious about maintaining a meditation practice.
      </p>
      <h3 class="meditation-types">Progressive relaxation</h3>
      <p>
        Also known as body scan meditation, progressive relaxation is a practice aimed at reducing tension in the body and promoting relaxation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oftentimes, this form of meditation involves slowly tightening and relaxing one muscle group at a time throughout the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, it may also encourage you to imagine a gentle wave flowing through your body to help release any tension.
      </p>
      <p>
        This <a href="bodyScan.html">form of meditation</a> is often used to relieve stress and unwind before bedtime.
      </p>
      <h3 class="meditation-types">Loving-kindness meditation</h3>
      <p>
        Loving-kindness meditation is used to strengthen feelings of compassion, kindness, and acceptance toward oneself and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        It typically involves opening the mind to receive love from others and then sending a series of well wishes to loved ones, friends, acquaintances, and all living beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this type of meditation. also known as <em>metta meditation</em> is intended to promote compassion and kindness, it may be ideal for those holding feelings of anger or resentment.
      </p>
      <p>The goal of metta meditation is to cultivate kindness for all beings, including yourself and:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>family</li>
        <li>friends</li>
        <li>neighbors</li>
        <li>acquaintances</li>
        <li>difficult people in your life</li>
        <li>animals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The main technique of metta meditation involves reciting positive phrases toward yourself and these beings</p>

      <h3 class="meditation-types">Visualization meditation</h3>
      <p>
        Visualization meditation is a technique focused on enhancing feelings of relaxation, peace, and calmness by visualizing positive scenes or images.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this practice, it’s important to imagine the scene vividly and use all five senses to add as much detail as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another form of visualization meditation involves imagining yourself succeeding at specific goals, which is intended to increase focus and motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you visualize, you focus on something specific — an event, person, or goal you want to achieve — and hold it in your mind, imagining your outcome becoming reality.

      <h2>How do i practise meditation?</h2>
      <p>Simple steps to do it on your own, make sure you’re somewhere where you can relax into this process, set a timer, and give it a shot:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take a seat
          Find place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.</li>
        <li>Set a time limit
          If you’re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Notice your body
          You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneel—all are fine. Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.</li>
        <li> Feel your breath
          Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.</li>
        <li>Notice when your mind has wandered
          Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes—simply return your attention to the breath.</li>
        <li>Be kind to your wandering mind
          Don’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come back.</li>
        <li>Close with kindness
          When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.</li>
      </ol>
